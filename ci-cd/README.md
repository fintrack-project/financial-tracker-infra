# FinTrack CI/CD Documentation

This document provides an overview of the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup for the FinTrack project.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is designed to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the FinTrack application. It ensures that code changes are integrated smoothly and deployed to production with minimal manual intervention.

## CI/CD Tools

- **Jenkins**: The primary tool used for automating the CI/CD pipeline. Jenkins is configured to monitor the repository for changes and trigger builds accordingly.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Build**: 
   - The application is built using Maven for the backend and npm for the frontend.
   - Docker images are created for the backend, frontend, and ETL pipeline.

2. **Test**: 
   - Unit tests and integration tests are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
   - Test reports are generated for review.

3. **Deploy**: 
   - The application is deployed to AWS using ECS for the backend and S3 for the frontend.
   - Kubernetes is used for orchestrating the deployment of the backend, frontend, and ETL services.

## Configuration

The Jenkins pipeline is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` located in the `ci-cd` directory. This file contains the necessary steps and configurations for the CI/CD process.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that all code changes are accompanied by tests.
- Regularly monitor the CI/CD pipeline for failures and address issues promptly.
- Keep dependencies up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

The CI/CD setup for FinTrack aims to streamline the development process, enhance code quality, and facilitate rapid deployment of new features and fixes.
